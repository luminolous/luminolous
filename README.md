## Project List

Here are some of the public projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

- [COPPA Risk Classification](https://github.com/luminolous/coppaRisk-classificationModel): Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict COPPA violation probabilities in mobile apps using metadata, EDA, feature engineering, and calibrated ensemble models.
- [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/luminolous/FraudDetection-GDGoC): Built an end-to-end pipeline to classify water quality data reliability by cleaning raw measurements, engineering domain-specific features, and training an XGBoost model.
- [Data Quality Classification](https://github.com/luminolous/data-quality-classification): Designed a fraud detection system using Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost models combined through weighted ensemble and threshold optimization for improved accuracy.
- [Match Triad Benchmark](https://github.com/luminolous/match-triad-benchmark): A comparative benchmark of CSP, Genetic Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing for solving student-tutor matching based on preferences.
