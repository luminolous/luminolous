Quick snapshot about me~💫

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/Ax-QQpA7FKsAAAAC/wakatsuki-nico.gif" alt="cute gif" />

- Focused on AI Research & Application
- Currently, I’m majoring in AI Engineering at Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology
- Right now I’m learning about Generation Model (Diffuser / Image Gen, LLMs, and Music too ૮₍ ´ ꒳ `₎ა ), and RVC
- I mostly code in Python, and sometimes JavaScript
- I’m usually listening to classical music 𝄞

<h2 align="left">🌊 Current arc?</h2>

I’ve been vibing with things like~✨

- **Diffusers / Image Generation**  
- **Music Generation Model** (*like DiT or any architecture*)
- **Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC)**
- **Language Models**  
- **Data Science** or something like that...  
- **AI engineering** under tight compute (*LoRA/LoRA+/PEFT and other “please fit in VRAM” rituals*)

I also have a soft spot for **anime (アニメ) datasets** — *images, audio, text…* <img src="public\𝐕𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐚 𝐙𝐞𝐭𝐚.jpg" height="18" alt="wave" />  
*if it’s about anime, I will probably try it at least once* (๑'ᵕ'๑)⸝*

On the side, I’m usually:  
turning anime data into small multimodal prototypes, hunting for more efficient (*and consistently functional*) architectures,  
reading biology/science stuff and going *“wait… can ML do that?”* 🧬,  
and training while listening to **classical / romance** music 🎻

*Occasionally, I touch grass too* (ごくまれに) (￣▽￣)ゞ

<h2 align="left">🫧 My Featured Project!</h2>

- ***Generative Models***
  - [*Frieren Diffusion LoRA*](https://huggingface.co/lumicero/frieren-waifu-diffusion-lora) -> In this project, I fine-tune a lightweight LoRA adapter for the Waifu Diffusion text-to-image model (hakurei/waifu-diffusion) using the CyberHarem Frieren dataset
  - [*Frieren Diffusion LoRA w/ Dreambooth*](https://huggingface.co/lumicero/frieren-waifu-diffusion-lora-db) -> In this project, I fine-tune waifu-diffusion model using DreamBooth with a lightweight LoRA adapter to learn Frieren’s identity

- ***LLMs***
  - [*X-LoRA for Cross Lingual Task in Qwen2.5-0.5B*](https://huggingface.co/lumicero/Qwen2.5-bilingual-xlora) -> Attempting to implement the X-LoRA architecture in a Bilingual (English-Indonesian) task. The datasets used were CendolCollectionv2 for Indonesian and OpenOrca for English
  - [*Qwen3 Astrophysics LoRA*](https://huggingface.co/lumicero/qwen3-astroph-lora) -> Finetuning Qwen3 - 1.7B using LoRA for astronomy QA

- ***Computer Vision***
  - [*FGVC in Nakano Siblings Image Classification*](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lumicero/FGVC-Nakano-Quintuplets) -> Implementation of Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) on The Quintessential Quintuplets Images Dataset using TransFG is a project that trains a fine-grained image classifier to distinguish between the five visually similar Nakano sisters (Ichika, Nino, Miku, Yotsuba, and Itsuki) using The Quintessential Quintuplets Images dataset
  - [*Chibi Style Detection*](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lumicero/Chibi-Style-Detection) -> Chibi Style Detection is a computer-vision project that determines whether an input image looks “chibi” or “non-chibi.” It’s built with Anomalib’s PatchCore, a memory-bank anomaly detection approach that compares patch-level CNN features against a stored set of “normal” features to produce an anomaly score and a localization heatmap.

- ***Tools & Framework***
  - [*MoeScraper*](https://github.com/luminolous/moescraper) -> Python toolkit/library to help retrieve and collect image data from anime image websites like danbooru, safebooru, and zerochan. It also supports searches based on desired tags and filters for NSFW images
  - [*Frameko*](https://github.com/luminolous/frameko) -> Python toolkit to convert video (animation or else) into multiple frames and collect them into an image dataset. This tool is can be used to add more data or collect a dataset that will be used to train a model

- ***Web Application***
  - [*Cross Lingual Waguri AI*](https://github.com/luminolous/CrossLingual-WaguriAI) -> Waguri AI is a bilingual chatbot web app built as a demonstration of fine-tuning Qwen2.5-0.5B using Mixture of LoRA Experts (X-LoRA) for the English–Indonesian pair. This web app is built using Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend
<!--
  - *Space for Diffusion Model LoRA Demo* -> 
  - *Space for Diffusion Model LoRA w/ Dreambooth Demo* -> 
-->
- ***Game Development***
  - [*Quantum Lite Chess*](https://github.com/luminolous/quantum-lite-chess) -> A Pygame-based chess game that adds a “quantum-lite” layer on top of standard chess rules: pieces can split into two destinations, the game can maintain multiple classical branches at once, and some events behave like probabilistic measurement/collapse
